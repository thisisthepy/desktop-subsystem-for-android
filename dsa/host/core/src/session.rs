//! The session: the guest container's life from start to stop, as the host sees it.
//!
//! A [`Session`] owns a worker thread. The thread starts the guest through a
//! [`GuestLauncher`], waits for the agent to connect on the control channel, checks the
//! connection with a [`Handshake`], and reports every state change. Requests return at
//! once; callers watch the state with [`Session::state`], [`Session::wait_for`] or
//! [`Session::events`].
//!
//! The states are those of the lifecycle: `Stopped`, `Starting`, `Active`, `Dozing`,
//! `Frozen` and `Stopping`. This module moves between `Stopped`, `Starting`, `Active` and
//! `Stopping`. Entering `Dozing` and `Frozen` belongs to the lifecycle policy, which is not
//! implemented yet; a session in either state can still be stopped.
